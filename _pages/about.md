I am a MD/PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania interested in the intersection of genome organization, gene regulation and human health. My thesis research with [Eric Joyce](https://ericjoycelab.com/) focused on developing [HiDRO (High-throughput DNA or RNA labeling with optimized Oligopaints)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.08.487672) to discover novel genome folding factors. I plan on pursuing residency in Pediatrics and Medical Genetics with the long-term goal of using imaging and genomics tools to advance the diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. 

The best way to reach me is daniel [dot] park [at] pennmedicine [dot] upenn [dot] edu (I know, it's a mouthful).
