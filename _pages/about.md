I am a Pediatrics and Medical Genetics resident at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) interested in clinical care of rare disease patients and research in genome organization and gene regulation. I completed my MD and PhD at the University of Pennsylvania and my thesis research with [Eric Joyce](https://ericjoycelab.com/) focused on developing [HiDRO (High-throughput DNA or RNA labeling with optimized Oligopaints)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06340-w) to discover novel genome folding factors. 

The best way to reach me is parkd [at] chop [dot] edu.
